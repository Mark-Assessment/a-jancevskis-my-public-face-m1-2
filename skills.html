                    <p>
                        Software Development is my passion. Unfortunately, it is more of a self-taught hobby. 
                        I took programming subjects in university, but they were more introductory. 
                        Universities gave me knowledge of what to do but not how. With the Code Institute course, 
                        I hope to fill that gap in my knowledge and get industry-like experience in coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following bars show my skill level (in my humble opinion).
                    </p>

                    <div class="progress-bar-outer">
                        <div class="progress-bar-inner w3-green" style="width: 80%;"><span class="w3-left">&nbsp;HTML</span><p class="no-padding-margin">80%</p></div>

                        <strong>Python</strong><br>
                        That is interesting. No one knows all libraries, so I stick to the basics. I worked with Django (my favourite) and statistics packages like 
                        Pandas and SciPy.

                        I have working experience with MySQL and Oracle (older versions).
                        The same applies to SQL.

                    <p>
                        Soft skills, also known as “people skills” or “interpersonal skills”, are not just personal attributes and abilities, 
                        they are the key to your professional success. They allow individuals to interact effectively with others in a professional setting, 
                        going beyond technical expertise and knowledge, and validating your unique contribution to the workplace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, even if one is average as a professional, the cultivation of soft skills cannot only open doors to growth and advancement, 
                        but also empower you with a sense of hope and possibility, igniting your personal journey of professional development.
                    </p>

                        Working in teams and leading them, adapting to a new work environment by learning fast, getting work done in time 
                        (crucial for Dispatch operations and Project management), and communicating the results clearly and 
                        understandably – these are not just soft skills; they are the practical tools that define who I am, 
                        and they can define your success too.

                        <strong>Warehousing and Logistics</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While working in a warehouse, I noticed practically everything a person working on a shop floor can see. 
                        I know how a warehouse works: receiving inbound stock and putting stock away on shelves or racking, picking, 
                        and dispatching. All information is stored in Knapp WMS, which I use to perform those operations. An essential 
                        role in the warehouse is the Inventory team, which I was part of. I even hold an NVQ Level 2 Diploma in Warehousing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dispatching orders always involves communication with drivers. Usually, it is done by the transport office team, 
                        a role I have experience in. In this role, 
                        I managed transport movements and the yard using a system C3 for transport and yard management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My commitment to maintaining a safe work environment is unwavering. I not only possess the necessary knowledge and 
                        skills to perform the job safely, but I am also dedicated to imparting this knowledge to others. 
                        This commitment ensures that I am a reliable asset in upholding health and safety standards in any warehouse operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>E-commerce</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you take a closer look, there are many things to consider, starting with building a shop and publishing products, 
                        synchronising quantities and prices, passing orders to suppliers, checking statuses, and providing customer service. 
                        Promoting your shop is addressing marketing and creating an online presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another two layers of e-commerce are the legal and financial side, which are usually not advertised because it may be 
                        complicated and scary for someone to start Dropshipping and buy advertised helper tools for product management. 
                        These activities include creating a company, opening a bank account, accepting payments online, and dealing with tax requirements. 
                        That is just the tip of the iceberg; I have gone through most of the parts.
